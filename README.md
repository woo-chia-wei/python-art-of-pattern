## About
This project consists of examples of mathematics problem solving and also visualization in mathematical concepts.

## Topics
1. [Random Walk](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/01_random_walk.ipynb) : A path where each steps is at the random decision (up, down, left, right) with equal probability 0.25.
2. [Prime Spiral](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/02_prime_spiral.ipynb) : A spiral constructed by integers from 1 at center, distribution of primes are indicated in red.

2. [Number arrangement](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/03_number_arrangement.ipynb) : Divide $1,2,3,...,2^n$ into equal partitions such that sum of $k$ th power is same for $k = 1,2,..., n-1$.

## Bonus
* Prime Spiral was originally written in Excel VBA, click [here](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/public/readme/028_Prime_Spiral.xlsm) to download the file. To launch the program, set the dimension and use ctrl + r to trigger the macro.
