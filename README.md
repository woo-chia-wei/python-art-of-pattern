## About
This project consists of examples of mathematics problem solving and also visualization in mathematical concepts.

## Topics
1. [Prime Spiral](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/prime_spiral.ipynb) : A spiral constructed by integers from 1 at center, distribution of primes are indicated in red
1. [Golden Spiral](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/golden_spiral.ipynb) : Logarithmic spiral drawing with golden ratio, other ratios are included as well
1. [Number Arrangement](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/number_arrangement.ipynb) : Divide 1,2,3,...,2^n into equal partitions such that sums of k th power equal for k = 1,2,..., n-1
1. [Random Walk](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/random_walk.ipynb) : A path where each steps is at the random decision (up, down, left, right) with equal probability 0.25

## Bonus
* Prime Spiral was originally written in Excel VBA, click [here](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/assets/028_Prime_Spiral.xlsm) to download the file. To launch the program, set the dimension and use ctrl + r to trigger the macro.
