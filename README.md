# About
This project consists of examples of mathematics problem solving and also visualization in mathematical concepts.

# Topics
* [2D Random Walk](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/topics/2d-random-walk.ipynb) : A path where each steps is at the random decision (up, down, left, right) with equal probability 0.25.
* [Prime Spiral](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/topics/prime-spiral.ipynb) : A spiral constructed by integers from 1 at center, distribution of primes are indicated in red.

# Bonus
* Prime Spiral was originally written in Excel VBA, click [here](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/the-art-of-pattern/blob/master/public/readme/028_Prime_Spiral.xlsm) to download the file. To launch the program, set the dimension and use ctrl + r to trigger the macro.
